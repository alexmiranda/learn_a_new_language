# WELCOME!

Tonight, you're going to learn a new programming language. 

You're brave! :-D

## What's the plan?

1. Organize in groups
2. 1 hour hacking
3. Demo time!

<!-- ## What's the plan? - Presenter notes

1. Let's arrange the groups (Min 3. Max. 6). Please decide who will be the spoke person.

🤠 Lone cowboys are welcome but we encourage you to form groups.

2. We will hack for 1 hour. Several challenges will be presented. Each challenge is assigned a score. Choose wisely!

3. After the hacking time, we will demo our achievements. Please, share your thoughts about the experience, the language, the tooling, etc. We would love ❤️ to hear about the challenges you faced! HackNight-VLC == Learning from each other!

<!-- Not so fast! - Presenter notes

Let's check the languages *you know*. Just for fun! 🥳

What does it mean "*you know*"?

- You have installed the tooling at some point in your life.
- You have learnt something about that language (enough to be able to write a hello world quickly).
- You have developed something (big or small) in that language, i.e., you have some hands-on experience.

What does *NOT* mean "*you know*"?

- You just know about the existence of the language because you heard someone talking out loud about it and then you googled it. 
- You wished to have done something with the language because it looks interesting but GoT, LoTR, The Wire, TWD, etc. seasons kept you away from the keyboard. Damn it! 🫠
